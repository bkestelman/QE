# QE
Quantum Entanglement Demonstration through violation of Bell's Inequality

## Setup Instructions

1. Use Linux

2. Install virtualenv to set up proper python environment. On systems with apt: `sudo apt install virtualenv`

3. Set up virtual environment and install necessary libraries:
- `virtualenv -p python3 venv` creates virtual environment using python 3
- `pip install matplotlib` for plotting graphs
- `sudo apt install python3-tk` GUI library for python 3 (required by matplotlib; not sure why this has to be through apt instead of pip)
